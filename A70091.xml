            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Dear FRIEND,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Et it be no wonder to you, that when I parted from you laſt, which was when I came into the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Regiment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in intended for <hi>France,</hi> that I ſhould give you no account of my Intentions, or Proceedings in that Affair. There were many things (which as repreſentations of your ill liking thereof) diſſwaded me from making you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted therewith: for I taking you as my real Friend, well knew the influence which you had always over me, ever ſince our firſt acquaintance; and that your many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (which you knew how well enough to fit up for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) would be Armour of Proof ſufficient againſt all the Weapons I could ever be able to uſe for my ſelf in that caſe. Theſe things thus working upon me, made me keep my mind to my ſelf, that as I would not be found openly acting againſt your will, ſo what I did do ſhould be without your knowledge. I did it raſhly at all adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and became a Volunteer in the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: as yet I have no cauſe to complain, nor in the leaſt to repent, from which I am as far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt; and do fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſolve, to ſpend all the remainder of my days in a Souldiers life.</p>
            <p>And now, <hi>SIR,</hi> I doubt not but you are deſirous to hear ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of our Procedure in this our Deſign into <hi>France;</hi> of which I can inform you as yet but of little, beſide what is reported as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongſt us. After our arrival upon the French Shore, we were kindly entertained among the French-men, where we had good Meat; Drink, Lodging, and other accommodations; as alſo our Coats, Hats, Hoſe, Shoes, Musket and Sword, and other Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, according to promiſe.</p>
            <p>We travelled three hundred and odd miles into the Country: during all which way and time, I met not with any ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in <hi>England;</hi> beſides the courteſie and civility of the people, and the Kings allowance; by which as we were wholly free from want, ſo nothing more could well be deſired by perſons in our condition. At length we came to a Town called <hi>Tontoiſe,</hi> where our whole Regiment was compleated, to the number of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and four hundred men at Arms, beſides Officers. We were
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58994:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 3 -->
thus compleated the twenty third of <hi>April</hi> laſt, being St. <hi>Georges</hi> Day, being Commanded by his Highneſs <hi>JAMES</hi> Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> under the Conduct and Banner of the King of <hi>France.</hi> The ſame Day we received Orders from His Highneſs, to march for the Camp on the 25 of <hi>April</hi> next following, which is now in <hi>Flanders:</hi> the whole bent of all the Kings Forces is againſt the Dutch, where, unleſs ſome ſtrange Providence prevent the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick deſigns of this Monarch, it cannot be judged leſs in reaſon, but that people, will not only prove really miſerable, but rather hazard a Certain deſtruction: For although it is true, that they may be really ſtrong by Sea; yet their ſtrength there, compared with the Engliſh, is no more than a Pigmy to a Gyant: But at Land (whatſoever they may be at Sea) their ſtrength is little, their Souldiers few, and of them the greateſt part (as far as I can hear by credible intelligence) very puſillaminous and faint-hearted.</p>
            <p>We have no fear no diſpair upon our Spirits, and it is judged it cannot be long before we come to the tryal of our Valour: Impoſſible it is but that ſome of us muſt be cut off; but we doubt not in the general to perform what we undertake, having ſo truly Noble a Perſon to be our Commander, and the Encouragement of ſo great a Prince.</p>
            <p>I am at this time in perfect health, and have not had the leaſt ſickneſs ſince I came into <hi>France;</hi> where I have lived, not only with much freedom and content of mind, beſides the pleaſantneſs of the journey; but alſo hope to live to return again into <hi>England,</hi> with much more ſatisfaction, than all my Friends were able to give me. I would have given you a larger account, but becauſe of my preſent occaſions and haſte, I am forced to be ſhort, and indeed ſhorter than I would: pray have reſpect for your Friend, and have me in remembrance in your daily prayers to God Almighty. My love to your ſelf, your wife and family, and to all the reſt of my friends in <hi>London,</hi> who enquire after my Welfare.</p>
